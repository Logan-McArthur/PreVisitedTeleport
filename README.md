# PreVisitedTeleport
Created by: Logan McArthur

An old project I created for a friend's Minecraft server.
It's a bukkit plugin that handles transportation for users on the server, allowing a user to instantly teleport to set waypoints only if they have previously visited it.
The project has gone through several iterations, and has been expanded to add a variety of features over the years it was maintained.
